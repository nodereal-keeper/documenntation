### What is NodeReal Gas Tracker?

### **What are the recommended user gas prices?**

**Standard** - is a gas price that is intended to be both cheap and successful. It may take a bit longer to get a confirmation with this price (e.g. 1 minute), but it is safe to use and should be confirmed promptly. This price is determined by the mined transactions. Furthermore, we monitor the network in real time and will update this price every block. \


**Fast** - is the price accepted by miners quickly. \


**Rapid** - This is accepted by all top miners. Paying more than this price is unlikely to increase transaction confirmation time under normal circumstances.
