### **Is there a charge for using Direct Route?**

Direct Route is currently in the Alpha stage and all services are free of charge in the short term. We will clarify the payment plan in the future.

&#x20;

### **How much voting power does Direct Route possess now?**

Direct Route currently mainly supports the BSC ecosystem. We have reached a cooperation agreement with 3+ nodes. We look forward to cooperating with more nodes in the near future.

&#x20;

### **Do you have testnet?**

The endpoint of testnet is  [**https://testnet-api.nodereal.io/direct-route**](https://testnet-api.nodereal.io/direct-route)**.**

###

### How is B**undle** priced?

**BundlePrice =  sum(gasPrice \* gasUsed) / sum(gasUsed) +  BNBToCoinbase/sum(gasUsed) \* nativeScale**

nativeScale=2  (This means that if you choose a bundle with deposit coinbase transactions, then your bundle will get higher priority execution.)

****

### How are **Direct Route** bundles sorted?

The Direct Route will sort all transactions by gas price, which is consistent with the typical BSC transaction sequence.
