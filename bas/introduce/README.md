# About BNB PoS SideChain

### What is BNB PoS SideChain?

BNB PoS SideChain is a framework for creating sidechains in the BSC ecosystem. In other words, it's an infrastructure to help developers and node operators build and run their own blockchains as their internal value system and for a massive number of users while still maintaining a close connection with BNB Chain (BSC).

The main BNB PoS SideChain task is to allow any developer to raise their blockchain in a matter of hours, with its unique specifications and validator set. Such blockchain, out-of-the-box, can be connected to the BSC infrastructure.

The validator set can run with fewer validators than BNB Chain, depending on the BAS deployer. The validators can be run by the application owners or any community stakeholders, bringing more flexibility and decentralization to BNB PoS SideChain. &#x20;

We can say this is a standard on which you can build simple but functional blockchain projects. Developers and teams can create simple blockchains with their own business rules and economies. Most importantly, they can extend the existing functionality.&#x20;
