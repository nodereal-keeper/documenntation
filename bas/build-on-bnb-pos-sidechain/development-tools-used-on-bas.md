# Development Tools used on BAS

## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts development with BAS enables you to build your smart contracts for any use, including cryptocurrency exchanges, smart contract-based dApps, Decentralized Finance, and more.

Smart contracts are programming logic that are executed automatically when a certain condition(s) are met. In BAS, smart contracts can be written in Solidity programming language.

Please refer to the [official documentation of Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/) for any queries.

## IDE and Libraries

Multiple IDEs and libraries can be used for developing and deploying smart contracts.

* [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/): powerful open source tool that helps you write Solidity contracts straight from the browser. It is written in JavaScript and supports both usage in the browser, but runs locally and in a desktop version. Remix IDE has modules for testing, debugging and deploying of smart contracts and much more.
* [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/teams/quickstart): development tool that allows users to compile, test, debug and deploy smart contracts.
* [Web3JS](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/): collection of libraries that allow you to interact with a local or remote ethereum node using HTTP, IPC or WebSocket.
