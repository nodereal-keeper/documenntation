## Create Your First App

Before you start sending RPC request on MegaNode, you will need to create an app first. App in MegaNode is a project-based unit, used to manage your API request. You need to input a name for your app, and also select a chain and its network.

After you have created an app, you can find a dashboard on the main screen.
