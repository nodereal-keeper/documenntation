## How monthly quota calculated by using team account?

We provide team account for free, and more importantly, the monthly quota(CUs) are calculated separately from you personal account. We sum all the CUs from the same app (API key) regardless of how many members are using it.



## Can I upgrade the pricing plan of team account?

Yes, if you're looking for the higher level of usage, you can upgrade the team account's pricing plan to get more CUs and more APIs.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that the pricing plan of team is standalone from your personal account. Only owner and admin can upgrade the pricing plan.
