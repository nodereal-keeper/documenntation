# eth\_getLogs - BSC

{% hint style="info" %}
The response size for getLogs method would be different according to your block range:

* **Block range > 50K**: Not available
* **Block range <= 100**: No response size limit
* **Block range between 100 and 50K**: Maximum 50K records would be responded
{% endhint %}

### Parameters

`Object` - The filter options:

* `address` _\[optional]_ - a string representing the address (20 bytes) to check for balance
* `fromBlock` _\[optional, default is "latest"]_ - an integer block number, or the string "latest", "earliest" or "pending"
* `toBlock` _\[optional, default is "latest"]_ - an integer block number, or the string "latest", "earliest" or "pending"
* `topics`_\[optional]_ - Array of 32 Bytes DATA topics. Topics are order-dependent.
* `blockhash`:_\[optional]_ With the addition of EIP-234, `blockHash` restricts the logs returned to the single block with the 32-byte hash `blockHash`. Using `blockHash` is equivalent to `fromBlock` = `toBlock` = the block number with hash `blockHash`. If `blockHash` is present in in the filter criteria, then neither `fromBlock` nor `toBlock` are allowed.

### Returns

*   `LOG OBJECTS` - An array of log objects, or an empty array if nothing has changed since last poll.

    * logs are objects with following params:
      * `removed`: true when the log was removed, due to a chain reorganization. false if it's a valid log.
      * `logIndex`: integer of the log index position in the block. null when its pending log.
      * `transactionIndex`: integer of the transactions index position log was created from. null when its pending log.
      * `transactionHash`: 32 Bytes - hash of the transactions this log was created from. null when its pending log.
      * `blockHash`: 32 Bytes - hash of the block where this log was in. null when its pending. null when its pending log.
      * `blockNumber`: the block number where this log was in. null when its pending. null when its pending log.
      * `address`: 20 Bytes - address from which this log originated.
      * `data`: contains one or more 32 Bytes non-indexed arguments of the log.
      * `topics`: Array of 0 to 4 32 Bytes of indexed log arguments. (In solidity: The first topic is the hash of the signature of the event (e.g. Deposit(address,bytes32,uint256)), except you declared the event with the anonymous specifier.)
