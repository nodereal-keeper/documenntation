| Now the market is in a bull market, and there are a lot of transactions every day                          | You can only choose higher gas fee transactions from the public transaction pool for packaging. You will have to pay more to get higher returns, including a professional team to analyze and capture valuable transactions.  | Becoming a cooperative block producer of Direct Route will improve your profitability. You will be allocated with profitable blocks to process |
